# The idea is to present a CGI over https, allowing you to leave a note with a
# link that will work exactly once.
#
# The design attempts to be secure, both from non-root attackers on the server,
# or from remote attacks.
#
# Let's assume brute force attacks will be blocked on the IP level (say, any IP
# hitting the CGI 50 times in an hour will be blocked for a day). This won't
# stop brute force attacks local to the server, so suggestions would be welcome
# there too.
#
# The onetime directory has odd permissions - root owned, 0733, meaning you can
# read a file if you know it's name, but you can't list it.
